I'm Michael, an aspiring fisheries scientist, data analyst,
fly fisher, and Ph.D. Candidate in the [School of Resource and
Environmental Management][REM] at [Simon Fraser University][SFU] working with
Drs. [Randall Peterman][RMP] and [Sean Cox][SPC].

My research uses macroecological and cross-system comparative approaches to
better understand the dynamics of marine ecosystems. In particular, I am
interested in the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine and anadromous fish
populations and how perturbations to marine ecosystems (e.g., climate
variability, fishing, etc.) alter these dynamics.

Being an analytical person by nature, my research is guided by the idea that
thoughtful data visualizations and the careful application of simulation and
statistical models are fundamental to furthering our understanding of complex
natural systems. I particularly enjoy leveraging novel data visualization
methods to better communicate scientific results and associated uncertainties.

I completed my Master's degree at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks][UAF] with
[Dr. Milo Adkison][MA] where I studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of coho
salmon populations throughout Southeast Alaska. My Ph.D. research investigates
the macroecology of Pacific salmon in the marine environment with a particular
focus on how environmental change influences salmon dynamics across their North
American ranges.
