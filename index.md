I'm Michael, a budding fisheries oceanographer, data analyst,
and Ph.D. Candidate in the [School of Resource and Environmental
Management][REM] at [Simon Fraser University][SFU] working with Drs.
[Randall Peterman][RMP] and [Sean Cox][SPC].


I am a very quantitative person and enjoy visualizing, simulating,
and modeling data. I love sharing my passion for all things
quantitative and teach several workshops on using the [R programming
environment][R] for data analysis and visualization. 


My academic research interests revolve around the spatial and
temporal dynamics of marine fish populations and how climate
variability influences these dynamics. My research covers a broad
array of disciplines including, ecology, oceanography, natural
resource management, statistics, modeling, and decision theory.


I completed my Master's degree at the [University of Alaska
Fairbanks][UAF] with [Dr. Milo Adkison][MA] where I studied the
effects of hatchery releases of pink and chum salmon on coho salmon
through time and space. My Ph.D. research investigates how
variability in climate and ocean processes influence the dynamics of
Pacific salmon populations throughout North America. In particular,
my Ph.D. research focuses on:

1. Spatial synchrony of the spring phytoplankton bloom and how it
   compares to spatial synchrony seen among salmon populations.

2. Temporal variability in ocean currents and how it relates to
   salmon productivity.

3. How to account for uncertainties and indirect effects when
   modeling the effects of climate and ocean variability on salmon
   populations.
