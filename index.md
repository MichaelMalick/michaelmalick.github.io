title:  Michael Malick | About

I'm a quantitative ecologist and fisheries oceanographer at [NOAA
fisheries][NMFS] in Seattle, WA. I synthesize complex ecological and
oceanographic datasets to improve predictions of climate impacts on marine
species.

My research is broadly guided by the idea that careful applications of
statistical and simulation models can improve our ability to develop management
strategies that are robust to climate change and ecological surprises.

In my current position as an [NRC postdoctoral research fellow][NRC], I am part
of a [diverse team of scientists][JSCOPE2] studying spatiotemporal dynamics of
Pacific hake along the west coast of North America. As part of this project, I
am leading research to develop 6-month ahead forecasts of Pacific hake spatial
distribution using seasonal projections of ocean conditions from the [J-SCOPE
model][JSCOPE1].


My areas of active research include:

- Climate and ocean impacts on the spatiotemporal dynamics of fish demographics,
  e.g., [ocean currents][CURRENTS], [phytoplankton dynamics][PHYTO]
- Nonstationary dynamics of fish populations and climate effects, e.g., [time
  varying productivity][TRENDS]
- Untangling the [pathways linking climate processes and fish dynamics][BNET]
- Ecosystem based management strategies for transboundary species, e.g.,
  [Pacific salmon][EBFM] and Pacific hake

My Ph.D. thesis at Simon Fraser University examined environmental forcing
pathways linking climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon
populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. In this work, I used a range of
quantitative modeling techniques (e.g., Bayesian hierarchical models,
probabilistic networks, and state-space models) to identify spatially coherent
effects of environmental forcing on productivity of salmon populations
throughout North America. In my M.Sc. thesis at the University of Alaska
Fairbanks, I examined how environmental forcing impacts the spatial and temporal
dynamics of coho salmon populations throughout Southeast Alaska.
