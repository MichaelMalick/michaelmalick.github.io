I'm Michael, a fisheries oceanographer, data analyst, fly fisher, and
post-doctoral researcher affiliated with [Oregon State University][OSU] and the
[National Marine Fisheries Service][NMFS] in Seattle, Washington.

Being an analytical person by nature, my research is guided by the idea that the
careful application of quantitative models and thoughtful data visualizations
are fundamental to furthering our understanding of complex natural systems. My
research uses macroecological and cross-system comparative approaches to better
understand the dynamics of marine ecosystems. I am particularly interested in
the spatial and temporal dynamics of marine and anadromous fish populations and
how perturbations to marine ecosystems (e.g., climate variability, fishing,
etc.) alter these dynamics.

My Ph.D. thesis at [Simon Fraser University][SFU] examined environmental forcing
pathways linking climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon
populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. In this work, I used a range of
quantitative modeling techniques (e.g., Bayesian hierarchical models,
probabilistic networks, and state-space models) to identify spatially coherent
effects of environmental forcing on productivity of salmon populations
throughout North America. In my M.Sc. thesis at
the [University of Alaska Fairbanks][UAF], I examined how environmental forcing
impacts the spatial and temporal dynamics of coho salmon populations throughout
Southeast Alaska.
