We analyzed the effects of the spring bloom timing on pink salmon productivity
(adults produced per spawner) in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to better
understand the mechanisms linking biological oceanographic conditions to Pacific
salmon population dynamics.

Using a combination of single stock and hierarchical models, we estimated the
effect of the spring bloom timing on each of 27 pink salmon stocks, as well as
an overall regional effect across all stocks. Our results indicated that the
spring bloom timing was significantly correlated with salmon productivity for
both northern (Alaska) and southern (British Columbia) populations, although the
correlations were opposite in sign. An early spring bloom was associated with
higher productivity for northern populations and lower productivity for southern
populations. Overall, our results suggest that changes in spring bloom timing
resulting from natural climate variability or anthropogenic climate change could
potentially cause latitudinal shifts in salmon productivity.
