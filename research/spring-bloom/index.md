# Linking phytoplankton phenology to salmon productivity along a north/south gradient

We analyzed the effects of the spring bloom timing on pink salmon productivity
(adults produced per spawner) in the Northeast Pacific Ocean to better
understand the mechanisms linking biological oceanographic conditions to Pacific
salmon population dynamics. Using a combination of single stock and hierarchical
models, we estimated the effect of the spring bloom timing on each of 27 pink
salmon stocks, as well as an overall regional effect across all stocks.

Our results indicated that the spring bloom timing was significantly correlated
with salmon productivity for both northern (Alaska) and southern (British
Columbia) populations, although the correlations were opposite in sign. An early
spring bloom was associated with higher productivity for northern populations
and lower productivity for southern populations. Overall, our results suggest
that changes in spring bloom timing resulting from natural climate variability
or anthropogenic climate change could potentially cause latitudinal shifts in
salmon productivity.
